For this assignment I decided to make a capture the flag/scavenger hunt game. For the collaborative aspect the players can work together to find the yellow button in the maze. For the competitive aspect, the players choose a team and need to find the other team's button to win. I decided on a 3D game, where the players use the WASD controls to maneuver through the maze, and their mouse to click on the “flag” when it is found. 


I had trouble getting the button colours to change. For some reason when changing the colours, the button stopped working all together. I spent a lot of time trying to get this to work but inevitably had to close the application and restart it. Another challenge I faced was trying to get the player to not be able to walk through walls. I was not able to figure out how to fix this problem without using aframe-extras.


A part of the assignment that went well was setting up the layout of the game. I enjoyed creating walls for the user to go around in order to search for the buttons. Since all the walls were the same colour, it was difficult to set them up without them overlapping. To solve this, I started by changing every wall to a different colour and moving them accordingly.
